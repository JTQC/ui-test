# ui-test

Based on the layout provided, I decided to use CSS Grid to replicate - however this is my first time using Grid, and though I'm very happy with the results on the desktop page, a bug came up where the media query for max-width is not working (what's strange is that it works fine if it is changed to min-width)

The instructions asked for a mobile layout, so I've included that in my scss/css and also an image to show what it plays out as.  Unfortunately I can't find a solution to the bug, so rather then delay sending this in to you all, I figured better to explain and submit. 

Thank you for your consideration!
